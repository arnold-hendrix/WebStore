# WebStore
This was a project from one of my courses. It's a simple client/server app created using winforms for the UI and a console app for the backend. Some predfined products are loaded into a 
combobox on the UI, and a user is able to make purchases by selecting a product and clicking the purchase button. The users are also predefined. It allows multiple users.
